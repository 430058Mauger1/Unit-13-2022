# Colour schemes

#####  Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=a3R3i0k++mOZDEL+Wsq+Yhm+RaK

   I have decided to use these colours because they are similar the the owners logo and the owner would like them to look similar.
   
   I will use the primary and secondary colours in backgrounds in my website, buttons and searchbars.

I decided to use this colour for the alternate website design because I noticed some of the websites I was referencing used it like tesco mobile.

# fonts
## website one
for website one i have decided to use the Open Sans font because it was optimised for web layouts and mobile interfaces
