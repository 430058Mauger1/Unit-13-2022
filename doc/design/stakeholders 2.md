# Colour schemes
Color Palette by Paletton.com
#####  Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=a3R3i0k++mOZDEL+Wsq+Yhm+RaK

![image](Colourscheme.JPG) 

   I have decided to use these colours because they are similar the the owners logo and the owner would like them to look similar.
   
   I will use the primary and secondary colours in backgrounds in my website, buttons and searchbars.

## Alternate colour scheme

I decided to use this colour for the alternate website design because I noticed some of the websites I was referencing used it like tesco mobile.

# Fonts
## Website one
for website one i have decided to use the Open Sans font because it was optimised for web layouts and mobile interfaces

# webpage requirments
My webpage should have a fast and responsive layout that should be clean and quick to load because customers forms their opinions whithin the first few seconds. the Navigation needs to be simple and understandable so customers can easily find what they want It's colour scheme needs to fit well together and with the site. My website also needs a grid and a youtube video.

## website feedback
Daine: "It looks good, its easy to navigate and its functional overall, there is nothing I would really change however there isnt any back buttons"

Patryk: "I like your colour scheme it fits well together, the font is cool and i like the text colour overall i like the colours and icons used however the phone descriptions are too small and the homepage title is too small"

## my website review
The targeted audience for my website are customers who are interested in buying phones and their accessories.

I think my website has fulfilled its intended purpose because it is a working site with the intended content like phones and accessories for them.

I have acknowledged the feedback and concluded that i do not need to add any back buttons because browsers usualy have them however some customers might be on a browser that does not have any back buttons so I will keep them in mind for the future.

For the phone description I have changed the font size from 8px to 9px I cant go any larger or the text will start to leave the grid.
